# JsSkal  
JsSkal is the javascript version of Pyskal (https://github.com/pr0crustes/Pyskal)  
JsSkal converts a text input into a image, using MD5 and numjs.

The MD5 function used was taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14733374/how-to-generate-md5-file-hash-on-javascript , and was not made by me.
