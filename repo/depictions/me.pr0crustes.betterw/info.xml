		<description>A bunch of whatsapp features: - No Read Receipt, that prevents others from seeing when you read a message, but still allowing you to see when others read yours. 2 - Who Is Online (BETA), that allows you to see who is online, drawing a green or red circle around their profile picture. 2.1 - As Dot, replaces the Who Is Online indicator with a dot. Who Is Online needs to be enabled. 3 - Confirm Call, that asks you to confirm your desire to call another user, preventing accidental voice / video calls.   4 - Don't Delete (BETA), will make so that when someone deletes a message, it does not delete in your device, adding a alert at the top of the message, alerting that the message was saved from oblivion. 5 - No Delete Limit, allowing you to revoke messages after more than 7 minutes. 6 - Never Online, makes so that you are never online (but currenly prevents you from seing when others are online). 7 - Never Typing, so others will not be able to see when you are typing. 8 - Global Support, adds whatsapp support to ipad | ipod. Should be enabled in settings.</description>
