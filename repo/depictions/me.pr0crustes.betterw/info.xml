		<description>A bunch of whatsapp features: <br/> - No Read Receipt, that prevents others from seeing when you read a message, but still allowing you to see when others read yours. <br/> 2 - Who Is Online (BETA), that allows you to see who is online, drawing a green or red circle around their profile picture. <br/> 2.1 - As Dot, replaces the Who Is Online indicator with a dot. Who Is Online needs to be enabled. <br/> 3 - Confirm Call, that asks you to confirm your desire to call another user, preventing accidental voice / video calls. <br/>   4 - Don't Delete (BETA), will make so that when someone deletes a message, it does not delete in your device, adding a alert at the top of the message, alerting that the message was saved from oblivion. <br/>   5 - Global Support, adds whatsapp support to ipad | ipod. Should be enabled in settings. <br/>   6 - No Delete Limit, removing the time limit to delete a message. <br/> </description>
